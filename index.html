<p>Welcome to Betterputting. My name is Kristian Bressum, I am an elite golfer who has spent several years perfecting my putting.</p>
<p>Here are some notes that I have learned throughout all that hard work. It's a shortcut for you to make the right decisions right away.
You can improve your putting without practicing, and you will find that there is more to putting than just starting the ball on the right line.

<p class="prevent-select"> Play more break on lag putts. The ball ends up closer to the hole if it’s played above the line, than over the line if played with the same amount of speed. The animation here under shows you two putts played with the same speed. The putt played under the correct line ends up 4 times further away than the one played above.</p>

<img src="/Users/kristianbressum/Desktop/My actual page/lagputt.png" width="400px";>

<h2> Important strategy knowledge </h2>
<p class="prevent-select"> Generally, you need to try to always putt the ball with the same speed. Which is 1-2 feet past the hole, whether it’s downhill, breaking, uphill or straight. But there are some rules. 

<br>Speed, on lag putts, try to make to ball stop on the hole. On putts from 20-10 feet try to roll the ball 1 foot by the hole. 
<br>On putts from 6-10 feet roll the ball 1-2 feet by the hole. On putts from 0-5 feet do NOT leave the ball short.
<br>It is noticeable that the avg. hole-out from 20 feet on the PGA tour is around 20% so if they only hole 1 in 5 from 18 feet (6 meters) then why should you think that you’re going to hole it? When you’re outside of 20 feet, just try to get a 2-putt. </p>

<h2>Exceptions: </h2>
<p class="prevent-select">If your putt is very downhill you should sometimes just focus on not 3-putting. 
<br>If you have a 20-30 footer that’s very uphill you can be more aggressive </p>

<h2> Strategy in your practice </h2>
<p class="prevent-select">
The most important putts to practice are putts from 4-15 feet. This is where the biggest difference between amateurs is. When practicing putting you should practice mostly from 4-10 feet and then lag putts from outside of 33 feet. 
<br> Why?
<br>Because of the difference between amateurs and PGA tour players. 
<br>From 0-3 feet there is not a big difference between amateurs and PGA tour players, most players 1-putt.
<br>From 4-15 feet there is a big difference between amateurs and PGA tour players. Most amateurs are closer to 2-putting and most PGA tour players are closer to 1-putting.
<br>From 15-33 feet most players 2-putt.
<br>From 33 feet and out - there is a significant difference between PGA tour players and amateurs. Amateurs 3-putt more. 
</p>

<h1 id="practice">Practice</h1>
<h2> Starting line: </h2>
<p class="prevent-select">
Practice your starting line. This the most commonly practiced skill in putting, but not necessarily the most important. Good drills for this practice would be to setup a 2 inch (5 cm) gate of 2 tees 1.5 feet (45 cm) from the ball and seeing how many times you can hit it through out of 10 tries. </p>
<img src="/Users/kristianbressum/Desktop/My actual page/startline.png" width="400px";>

<h2>Greenreading: </h2>
<p class="prevent-select"> Greenreading is an overlooked skill when it comes to practice. Practice greenreading by choosing a left-right and a right-left putt from around 7-12 feet. <br>Setup a tee where you think the ball needs to start. Setup your 2 inch (5 cm) gate 1.5 feet (45 cm) from the ball so that there’s a straight line from the ball through the gate to the tee. </p>
<img src="/Users/kristianbressum/Desktop/My actual page/aim.png" width="400px";>
<p class="prevent-select"> Putt until your ball rolls through the gate with 1-2 feet by the hole speed. If it goes in you read it correctly. Check if you over/underread putts. 
</p>
<p class="prevent-select"> Remember that a ball can go in on multiple lines depending on the speed, so sometimes you’ll be lucky the you overread the putt and don’t give it 1-2 foot by speed so it still goes in. Or that you underread it and you accidentally give it too much speed and it goes in. But to be as “lucky” as possible you need to be as good as possible at greenreading + speed. </p>
<p class="prevent-select"> 
  Look at the edges of the green. Does it clearly slope from one way to another? If it slopes back to front and you’re putting from the right back side of the green to the left front side of the green it will typically be breaking downhill right to left. You can look at the edges of the green, see which is higher and thereby decide how to read it. </p>
  <p class="prevent-select"> Balls can roll differently on different kinds of grasses. On bermuda grass you can look at the hole, and the side of the hole where the grass is more destroyed, that’s where it’s breaking. </p>
  <h2>Speed: </h2>
  <p class="prevent-select">
Always try to get the ball the same amount of distance past the hole, usually 1-2 feet past the hole. To practice speed set up tees, 6,9,12,15 and 18 feet from a tee. Hit 20 putts total try to hit the 3 feet space between the 6 foot and 9 foot tee, then the next space and so on. Redo when you’ve hit 4 putts. add gate at 1.5 feet for extra difficulty. The best putters in the world average 90% hitting their zones with gate. </p>

<h2>Tempo:</h2>
<p class="prevent-select">A good idea for tempo when putting is to have a metronome with a tempo that you putt at no matter the putt. So the putting stroke will take the same amount of time to do on a 3 foot putt as it would on a 60 foot putt. You can pactice putting different putts with the sound metronome. </p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k060CoJLuzk?si=rEFYcDU_a1JJw-AB" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p class="prevent-select"> A consistent putting stroke will make it easier to find the distance on putts. The only thing you need to adjust when you use the metronome is how long your backswing is. So everything will be constant but the length of the backswing. </p>

<h2>Aim:</h2>
<p class="prevent-select">People often blame missed putts on pulling or pushing putts when in fact they maybe just have aimed wrong. To have the most precise aim, you can train your aim. </p>

<p class="prevent-select">Take 3 putts, 1 left-right, 1 right-left and one seemingly straight putt on around 9 feet. read the putt and set up a tee where you think your ball have to start with one-two foot by speed for the ball to go in. Check with tool, laser or friend if you aim at the ball. If your aim is inside 1 inch on each side of the tee then it’s good. Have a friend stand behind you as you set up. Let them remove the ball and estimate where you are aiming. </p>

<p class="prevent-select">Aim can become more consistent by checking your setup in a mirror. Your eyes should be in line with the line that you’re trying to hit the ball on, and so should your shoulders. </p>
<p class="prevent-select">If you do not possess a mirror you can drop a ball from your left eye once you have set up and the ball you drop should hit the ball you intended to putt on the ground on the inside of the ball. </p>

<h2>Setup:</h2>
<p class="prevent-select">A good setup + grip is essential for hitting good putts. In putting many things can work. But generally you would like to stand with 25 centimeters from the edge of your toes to the ball, with the ball in the middle of the stance & with a 30 centimeter wide stance. </p>
<p class="prevent-select">Your left eye needs to be just under the ball. You can check this by setting up and dropping another ball from your left eye, it should barely hit the ball just on your side of the ball. </p>
<p class="prevent-select">Your eyes and shoulders should likely be in line with the line that you want to hit the ball on. This can be checked with a putting mirror. </p> 
<p class="prevent-select">It can be improved by taking your stance on the line with the putting line. Then standing up straight and looking forward. Then bend over totally straight and set up the putter. This should straighten out your eye alignment and shoulder alignment. </p>

<h2>Grip:</h2>
<p class="prevent-select">Many different grips work well for putting. 
Most PGA tour winners grip right hand low, second to most winners have left hand low, third most winners have even hands and then there is the claw grip which not a lot of good putters use, it works best on fast greens but I’d recommend one of the 3 first grips. </p>
<p class="prevent-select">One thing all grips needs usually is to have the grip in the palms, not the fingers. The putter should be an extension of your forearm. See picture for instruction. </p>
</div>

<div style="background-color : palevioletred; width: 105%;"> 
<h1 id="mentality and misunderstandings">Mentality and misunderstandings</h1>

<p class="prevent-select">There is a mentality when putting. It’s important to have confidence but it can be hard to have confidence. 
<br>Confidence for me does not mean that you’re hammering putts 4 feet past the hole. Sometimes it takes more confidence to drip it in. And a big question can be: Do you have a good confidence because you putt well? Or do you putt well because you have a good confidence? So no matter how you have been putting, believe in yourself because if you don’t it will be hard to be good. </p>
<p> Different mentalities that I’ve heard that I like: </p>
<p class="prevent-select"> 50/50 putter: <br>I’m a 50/50 putter. So if I missed the last putt, I’m going to make the next putt. But if I made the last putt, then I’m on a roll, and then I’ll make the next one. <br>(Heard from a tour rep) </p> 

<p class="prevent-select"> The bucket mentality: <br>Sometimes you go on the course and the hole looks like a bucket. You can’t miss. The hole is bigger today than usually. Imagine that you think the hole looks bigger. <br> (Heard from a 4-time DP world tour winner) </p>

<p class="prevent-select"> Hit the best putt you can, see if it goes in: Sometimes you’re worrying too much about making putts. You can also just go up there, do your technical things, read the putt and hit the best putt you can. Then it’s up to the green if the ball goes in, because you did the best that you could.</p>

<h1 id="drills">Drills</h1>

<h2> Luke donald (Kenneth Hansen) drill: </h2>
<p class="prevent-select">Hit 20 putts total. 
<br>4 putts from each 4,5,6,7 & 8 feet. 
<br>Select a hole. Hit putts from 4,5,6,7 & 8 feet from different spots around the hole. Then select new hole. 
<br>16 putts made is PGA tour average.</p>

<h2> Bressum Drill: </h2>
<p class="prevent-select">Hit 6 lag putts and 9 shorter putts.
<br>2 lag putts from each 15, 20 and 25 paces (steps). 
<br>3 putts from each 5,8 and 11 feet
<br>You start by choosing 1 hole. Putting out a 15-pace lag putt to the hole. Then putting a 5, 8, and 11-footer from different places around the hole. Then ending the hole with another lag putt from 15 paces. <br>You do the same thing on new holes with the 20-pace lag putts and the 25-pace lag putts.  </p>

<p class="prevent-select">Count total amount of putts: 
<br>23 putts or better = Bressum level
<br>24 putts = Kisner level
<br>25 putts = Tour level
<br>26 putts = really good
<br>27 putts = good 
<br>28 putts = acceptable
<br>29 putts or above = need more practice.</p>

<h2>Lag putt drill:</h2>
<p class="prevent-select">Putt out two putts from each 10, 15, 20, 25 & 30 paces. One uphill or right to left & one downhill or left-right.
<br>Goal should be to two putt 8/10 putts. </p>
